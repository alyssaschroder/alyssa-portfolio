Alyssa Schroder is a young, self-taught artist specializing in watercolour and inks. Raised near Toronto, Ontario, Alyssa moved to Owen Sound in 2012 with her husband. She works primarily with ink and watercolour, but has also experimented with various acrylic techniques.

Alyssa is drawn to the intricate detail of ink sketching when combined with the softness of watercolour paints. She believes in giving great freedom to the mediums – guiding the paint, but also allowing it to flow as it will. Her pieces often focus on simple human portraits inspired by her fascination with capturing an emotion, or a feeling. Alyssa’s everyday life experiences push her to paint and her desire is for the works to evoke the same feeling that she was first inspired by.
